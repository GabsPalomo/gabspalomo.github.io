<p><h1>My CV in pictures</h1></p>

> Here is a link to my [CV](/docs/gabriela_palomo_cv.pdf) but I include here photographs of everything I included as a way to represent my professional experience in pictures. Some of these were taken with a cellphone so the quality may not be ideal. The point, however, is to show some of the work I've done previously as well as the places where I've worked.

### Curator of the Vertebrate Collection at Del Valle University 
#### 2011-2017

> For six years, I was the curator of the vertebrate collection at del Valle University in Guatemala City. Guatemala only has two Zoological Collections. I worked here as an undergrad so when the University offered me this job I jumped at the opportunity.
