    "text": "My name is Gabriela Palomo, I am a carnivore ecologist and data scientist. I started this website to mainly talk about my projects and house my blog called My digital notebook. The idea behind my blog was to have a place that I can use as a digital notebook with notes on how I am learning and improving how to code in R. I like the idea of having a centralized website with an organized repository of all my scripts instead of having them scattered across multiple laptops and external hard drives. However, I think that others may find my code and explanations (i.e., blog posts) useful so I hope this blog can help others learn as well. I plan to cover from the most basic tasks/models to the more complex ones.\nThe easiest way to contact me is on BlueSky, where I’m very active, or you can send me an email to mgpalomo (at) uvg.edu.gt"

    "text": "rphylopic and ggplot2\nFirst we will start by installing ‘rphylopic’:\n\n# Stable version from CRAN\ninstall.packages('rphylopic')\n\n# Development version from github\n# install.packages('devtools')\ndevtools::install_github('palaeoverse-community/rphylopic')\n\nThen we load the following packages and dataset that we will use:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(rphylopic)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n# We will use the tree dataset \ndata(\"trees\")\n\n\nLet’s start with a simple plot\nThe trees dataset provides measurements of diameter, height, and volume of timber in 31 felled black cherry trees. The diameter is labled as girth in the dataset so let’s start by renaming it to diameter.\n\ntrees &lt;- trees %&gt;% \n  rename(Diameter = Girth) # new name = old name\n\n# Let's check that it worked \nnames(trees)\n\n[1] \"Diameter\" \"Height\"   \"Volume\"  \n\n\nNow let’s fit a linear regression between Diameter and Volume. This is just a silly example just to have a graph on which we can plot a silhouette.\n\nggplot(trees,aes(Diameter, Volume)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula = y~x) +\n  theme_classic()+\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(face = 'bold', size = 16),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 14)) -&gt; ourplot\nourplot \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s put a silhouette on that plot!\nLet’s start by checking if we have silhouettes for the species we want. In this case a black cherry tree which is Prunus serotina\n\nbct &lt;- pick_phylopic(name = 'Prunus serotina')\n\nError in get_uuid(name = name, n = n, url = FALSE) : Image resource not available for name. Ensure provided name is a valid taxonomic name or try a species/genus resolution name.\nWe got an error saying there are no available silhouettes for this species (note to self, we should draw this and upload it asap!). So let’s check another one that looks like our black cherry trees. How about Flowering Dogwood, Cornus florida. It’s not the same species obviously but the silhouette could represent either tree. Not ideal but for this example I suppose it’s ok.\n\nbct &lt;- pick_phylopic(name='Cornus florida')\n\nWarning in get_uuid(name = name, n = n, filter = filter, url = FALSE): Only 1\nitem(s) are available.\n\n\nThis is the only image.

Sometimes, you get a species with more than one silhouette but you can see them all by typing 1 on the console when prompted. See my tweet here for an example on how to do this.\nNow back to our plot. Let’s add a silhouette. To know where to place it, think of the arguments x and y as coordinates on your graph, and the silhouette as a point you want to place in the plot. So here, I wanted it on the lower left part of the plot, which corresponds with x=20 and y = 10. The center of the silhouette will be placed on that point. The ysize argument controls how tall the silhouette will be, and is in relation to the y-axis scale.\n\nourplot +\n  add_phylopic(img = bct, # silhouette \n               x=20, # based on x axis coordinates\n               y=10, # based on y axis coordinates \n               ysize = 20) -&gt; ourplot \nourplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s put the silhouette next to a legend\nNow because we want the silhouette outside the plot, we must set the coordinates to negative. In this case, the legend is at the bottom so we set the y-axis coordinates to -20.\n\nggplot(trees,aes(Diameter, Volume)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula = y~x, aes(color = 'lm')) +\n  scale_color_manual(name = 'Legend', values = 'blue')+\n  theme_classic()+\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(face = 'bold', size = 16),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 14),\n        legend.position = 'bottom',\n      # The backgroun of the legend set to transparent because it \n      # overlaps the silhouette\n        legend.background = element_rect(fill=\"transparent\"))+\n  add_phylopic(img = bct, # silhouette \n               x=13, # based on x axis coordinates\n      # The y must be set to negative so it's outside the plot\n               y=-19, # based on y axis coordinates \n               ysize = 8) -&gt; ourplot_legend \nourplot_legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than one silhouette on the plot\nIf you want to add more than one silhouette, then just use the ‘add_phylopic()’ function again. I re-used the same silhouette, but you could use another one here.\n\nourplot +\n  add_phylopic(img = bct, # First silhouette \n               x=20, # based on x axis coordinates\n               y=10, # based on y axis coordinates \n               ysize = 20)+ # based on y axis coordinates \n  add_phylopic(img=bct, # Second silhouette \n               x=10, \n               y=70, \n               ysize = 30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints as silhouettes\nIf you wanted the points to be little trees instead of points, then you can do so like this. I personally don’t like plots like this but I am showing you it’s possible:\n\nggplot(trees,\n       aes(Diameter, Volume)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method='lm', formula = y~x) +\n    theme_classic()+\n    theme(axis.title = element_text(face = 'bold', size = 16),\n          axis.text = element_text(size = 14)) -&gt; plot2\n\nfor(i in 1:nrow(trees)){\n    plot2 &lt;-  plot2 + # These two names must match \n    add_phylopic(img = bct, \n                 x = trees$Diameter[i],\n                 y = trees$Volume[i], \n                 ysize = 5)\n}\n\nplot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s not forget the attribution\nNow let’s not forget to add the attribution of the silhouette to the plot!

    "text": "If you are a researcher, one of my biggest pieces of advice is to make a website. It doesn’t matter if you are just starting grad school or have already graduated. The main idea behind having a website is to control how other researchers —or the media, potential employers, etc.— may find you. And then, of course, so that you can have all your papers readily available, as well as your CV/resume, etc. However, if you DO NOT have a website or have been postponing it because why do it today if you can do it tomorrow, then at least make sure other researchers can easily find ways to contact you.\nLast week, I emailed a group of researchers about a possible collaboration with me. I could find everyone’s email within seconds EXCEPT for one. I kept looking, but after 7 minutes I gave up, which meant that I wouldn’t be able to contact him/her and they would lose the opportunity to be in this collaboration -or at least to know about it even if they decline to be involved. So I started thinking about ways to make your email public without necessarily having a website.\nHere, I give you some ideas on how to make your email easy to find without having to create a website.\n\n\nIf you don’t have an (ORCID ID)[orcid.org] then I suggest you start one today. Basically, it’s like having a website for academics who publish but without photos. Every time you publish a paper, it will appear listed on your orcid website. In their website, orcid states that ‘You can connect your iD with your professional information — affiliations, grants, publications, peer review, and more.’. Another great thing is that you can have all the ways in which your name may appear on a publication.

    "text": "If you are a researcher, one of my biggest pieces of advice is to make a website. It doesn’t matter if you are just starting grad school or have already graduated. The main idea behind having a website is to control how other researchers —or the media, potential employers, etc.— may find you. And then, of course, so that you can have all your papers readily available, as well as your CV/resume, etc. However, if you DO NOT have a website or have been postponing it because why do it today if you can do it tomorrow, then at least make sure other researchers can easily find ways to contact you.\nLast week, I emailed a group of researchers about a possible collaboration with me. I could find everyone’s email within seconds EXCEPT for one. I kept looking, but after 7 minutes I gave up, which meant that I wouldn’t be able to contact him/her and they would lose the opportunity to be in this collaboration -or at least to know about it even if they decline to be involved. So I started thinking about ways to make your email public without necessarily having a website.\nHere, I give you some ideas on how to make your email easy to find without having to create a website.\n\n\nIf you don’t have an (ORCID ID)[orcid.org] then I suggest you start one today. Basically, it’s like having a website for academics who publish but without photos. Every time you publish a paper, it will appear listed on your orcid website. In their website, orcid states that ‘You can connect your iD with your professional information — affiliations, grants, publications, peer review, and more.’. Another great thing is that you can have all the ways in which your name may appear on a publication. For example, if your name is Andrew but sometimes people call you Andy or Drew then you can list them all here so that your publications can be linked here no matter the way your name was spelled.\nGreat! How do you make your email be visible here?\n\nOn orcid’s website, you can control if you want all or just some of your emails public (green circle), only visible to orcid users who have logged in (yellow circle with a key), or private, which is visible only to you (red circle with lock).

Remember that you can always check the uuid for any silhouette by first running the function get_uuid(name = ‘genus species’).\nby calling the species name: add_phylopic_base(name=‘genus species’), or\nby loading a saved image in your working directory: add_phylopic_base(img=img)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualize silhouettes in the viewer\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using RStudio, then you can visualize the silhouettes for any species -or whatever taxonomic category- in the viewer. This is especially useful for species that have multiple silhouettes.\npick_phylopic(name = ‘Canis lupus’)\nAnd type 1 in the console to change to the following silhouettes.\nOnce you picked a specific silhouette, then you can do the following which will save the uuid to ‘sil’.\nsil &lt;- pick_phylopic(name = ‘Canis lupus’, n=1)\n\n\n\n\n## First we load the rphylopic package \n# install.packages('rphylopic')\nlibrary(rphylopic)\n\nYou are using rphylopic v.1.3.0. Please remember to credit PhyloPic contributors (hint: `get_attribution()`) and cite rphylopic in your work (hint: `citation(\"rphylopic\")`).\n\n## Then we make the plot \n## Now the basic scatter plot \nplot(dbh ~ Height, data = trees,\n     xlab = 'Height', \n     ylab = 'DBH',\n     font.lab = 14, # x and y labels Using font 14 which I think is Century Gothic. \n     font.axis = 14,\n     ylim=c(0,20),\n     pch = 20)\ntitle(main = \"Graph in base r\",\n     adj = 0,\n     font.main = 15, # main title font family 15 is 14 in bold\n     cex.main = 2) # font size of main title)\ntitle(sub = \"Source: trees\",\n      font.sub = 14,\n      cex.sub = 0.75,\n      adj = 1,)\n## I want shaded confidence intervals so for that we will use \n## the function polygon()\npolygon(c(nd$nd, rev(nd$nd)),\n        c(nd$lwr,rev(nd$upr)),\n        col=adjustcolor('dodgerblue', alpha=0.1),\n        border=NA)\n## Now let's add the fitted line from the lm model\nabline(m, col = \"#00688B\",  lwd = 2)\n\n## Now we add the silhouette! \nadd_phylopic_base(name = 'Cornus florida', \n                  x = 85, \n                  y = 5,  \n                  ysize = 7) # This is in the same scale as your y-axis\n\nWarning: You've used the `name` argument. You may want to use `verbose = TRUE`\nto get attribution information for the silhouette(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key thing to keep in mind is that what guides the position and size of the silhouette inside the plot is the scale you are using in that plot. In this case, the size I chose for the silhouette ysize=7 is in relation to the y-axis scale, which in this case is 7 units in y-axis. The position corresponds with the x- and y-axis coordinates. See how the center of the silhouette is at x=85 and y=5."
