	abstract = {The expansion of urban areas and anthropogenic activities have intensified human–wildlife interactions, increasing zoonotic disease emergence and transmission. Understanding factors influencing urban wildlife movement and their interactions with humans is critical for addressing disease transmission. We examine factors driving zoonotic risks in urban ecosystems, emphasizing the human–wildlife interactions, and suggest their integration into a One Health framework. Urban environments facilitate contact with wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens such as rabies, Lyme disease, and SARS-CoV-2. Factors such as green spaces, altered wildlife behavior, and human mobility amplify disease spillover risks. We emphasize applying movement ecology concepts, particularly for understanding how animals and humans navigate and use urban spaces to identify hotspots interaction and inform management strategies. Despite advancements, challenges such as data standardization and limited interdisciplinary collaboration persist. We advocate for an integrative approach combining animal movement ecology, human mobility, and public health to foster coexistence and safeguard human health.},

	abstract = {Human expansion into wildlife habitats has increased the need to understand human–wildlife interactions, necessitating interdisciplinary approaches to assess zoonotic disease transmission risks and public health impacts. This study integrated fine-grained human foot traffic data with hourly GPS data from 38 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), a species linked to SARS-CoV-2, brucella, and chronic wasting disease, in Howard County, Maryland. We explored spatial and temporal overlap between human and deer activity over 24 months (2018–2019) across a hexagonal tessellation with metrics like hourly popularity and visit counts. Negative binomial models were fitted to the visit counts of each deer and humans per tessellation area, using landscape features as predictors. A separate deer-only model included commercial human activity as another predictor. Spatial analysis showed deer and humans sharing spaces in the study area, with results indicating deer using more populated residential areas and areas with commercial activity. Temporal analysis showed deer avoiding commercial spaces during daytime but using them in late evening and early morning. These findings highlight the complex space use between species and the importance of integrating detailed human mobility and animal movement data when managing wildlife–human conflict and zoonotic disease transmission, particularly in urban areas with a high probability of deer–human interactions.},

However, we lack data and a standardized framework to accurately assess and compare temporal activity for species during rapid ecological change. Through a global network representing 38 countries, we leveraged 8.9 million mammalian observations to create a library of 14,587 standardized diel activity estimates for 445 species. We found that less than half the species’ estimates were in agreement with diel classifications from the reference literature and that species commonly used more than one diel classification. Species diel activity was highly plastic when exposed to anthropogenic change. Furthermore, body size and distributional extent were strongly associated with whether a species is diurnal or nocturnal. Our findings provide essential knowledge of species behavior in an era of rapid global change and suggest the need for a new, quantitative framework that defines diel activity logically and consistently while capturing species plasticity.

            Many species of mammals worldwide are highly plastic in their timing of diel activity, which has unknown fitness consequences.},

              Motivation
              SNAPSHOT USA is an annual, multicontributor camera trap survey of mammals across the United States. The growing SNAPSHOT USA dataset is intended for tracking the spatial and temporal responses of mammal populations to changes in land use, land cover and climate. These data will be useful for exploring the drivers of spatial and temporal changes in relative abundance and distribution, as well as the impacts of species interactions on daily activity patterns.
            
            
              Main Types of Variables Contained
              SNAPSHOT USA 2019–2023 contains 987,979 records of camera trap image sequence data and 9694 records of camera trap deployment metadata.
            
            
              Spatial Location and Grain
              Data were collected across the United States of America in all 50 states, 12 ecoregions and many ecosystems.
            
            
              Time Period and Grain
              Data were collected between 1st August and 29th December each year from 2019 to 2023.
            
            
              Major Taxa and Level of Measurement
              The dataset includes a wide range of taxa but is primarily focused on medium to large mammals.
            
            
              Software Format
              SNAPSHOT USA 2019–2023 comprises two .csv files. The original data can be found within the SNAPSHOT USA Initiative in the Wildlife Insights platform.},
