## Scientific Diagrams 



The following diagrams are not organized in any particular order. At some point, when I have several linked, I'll organize them by categories. 

1. **Soares et al. 2022**  

Islands are becoming taxonomically and functionally more similar after losing unique bird species and gaining common widespread birds.

5. **Naves-Alegre et al. 2022**
