## Scientific Diagrams 



The following diagrams are not organized in any particular order. At some point, when I have several linked, I'll organize them by categories. 

1. **Soares et al. 2022**  

Islands are becoming taxonomically and functionally more similar after losing unique bird species and gaining common widespread birds.

2. **Pilowsky et al. 2022**

Modeling the mechanisms that govern the structure and dynamics of biodiversity.

4. **Broadley et al. 2019**

Space use is one factor affecting detections on CTs. Here, two aspects of space use are considered: home-range size and movement rate.

5. **Naves-Alegre et al. 2022**

Results of the spatial and spatio-temporal co-occurrence analyses between pairs of species, both qualitative co-occurrence and quantitative GLMs (spatial co-occurrence) and GLMMs (spatio-temporal co-occurrence) that relate the abundances of the species.

8. **Grames, Schwartz, Elphick. 2022.** 

Conceptual flowchart of a systematic process to develop conceptual models of alternative hypotheses in which (a) the scope of the research question is formally defined, (b) a systematic review is conducted, (c) researchers extract authors' hypotheses as implied causal relationships that are (d) merged into a graphical model that can be (e) analysed to identify trends in scientific thinking.
